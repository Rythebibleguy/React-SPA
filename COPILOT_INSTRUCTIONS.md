## Instructions
- Keep it simple: Concise responses, no unnecessary code snippets
- Ask, don't assume: Clarify anything ambiguous rather than guessing
- **No code changes without explicit approval**: Propose changes, explain the approach, and wait for me to explicitly say "do it", "implement it", or similar before making any edits
- Pitch multiple options: When discussing ways to add or change something, present 2-3 different approaches with pros/cons so I can choose
- Reuse existing code: Search for existing functions, patterns, or utilities before writing new code
