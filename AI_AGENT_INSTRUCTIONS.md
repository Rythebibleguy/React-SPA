# Session instructions (paste at start)

**Project:** React SPA — Bible quiz app (Vite, React, Firebase). Hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

## How to respond

- **Be concise.** Prefer short answers; skip code snippets unless they’re needed to explain.
- **Ask when unclear.** If something is ambiguous, ask instead of guessing.
- **Reuse first.** Before adding or changing behavior, search for existing functions, patterns, or utilities and use them.

---

## Readability

Format responses so they are easy to scan:

- **Short blocks** — 2–3 lines per paragraph; avoid walls of text.
- **Lists** — Use bullets or numbers when listing multiple points or steps.
- **Headings** — Use small section headers when the answer has several parts.
- **Highlight** — Use **bold** for the main takeaway or key terms.
- **Breaks** — Add a blank line between sections.

## Before making code changes

1. Say what you’ll change and why.
2. Briefly describe or show the changes.
3. Wait for explicit approval (e.g. “do it”, “yes”, “go ahead”) before editing.
4. Do not edit without confirmation, even if the request seems obvious.

---

## Proposing changes

- When there are several valid approaches, give **3 options** with pros/cons, then say which you recommend and why.
- If a bug persists after several attempts, suggest **adding debug logs** to find the cause instead of more guesswork.

---

## Design

- Use **NY Times Games** as the main UI/UX reference (patterns, layout, feel).

## Project notes

- **Start the server:** Run `npm run dev` at the start of each session.
- **Legacy:** `Old Code/` is the original HTML/CSS/JS version. Use for reference only; don’t copy-paste from it unless asked.
- **Dev server:** App at `http://localhost:5173/`; same WiFi devices can use the network URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.4:5173/`).
- **Production:** https://react-spa-57t.pages.dev/
